    <h1>Critical Making - Troubling Time</h1>
    <p>As I made the map, I created it in two stages: first, observing the locations that were given by Google as points of
    cultural importance, such as city hall, restaurants, parks, and retail stores; second, the locations I added that
    represented the tragic events leading up to the terrorizing of the four boys who were the victims of Sherrif McCall and
    other white supremacists in the town where I live, I realized maps, as research tools, “…are not neutral… nor are they
    fixed ones. As such, the work of inventing, repairing, and hacking methods is a necessary, if often underexplored, part
    of the wider research process” (Pasek)
