    <h1>Critical Making - Future</h1>
    <p>As my selfie went through rhetorical and conceptual changes, I thought of objectivity and subjectivity. My grandmother moved from El Salvador to the United States when she was a young mother. I often wonder how she did it. I know her story is one of thousands, and their voices are so important when making critically. Stories are told and heard in connection with power and privilege (D'Ignazio and Klein), and as I continue my research, I hope to lift those voices like my grandmother's.</P>
