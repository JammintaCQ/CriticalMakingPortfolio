    “The recognition that one cannot know the other or the self but must ask in respect for all of time who and what are
    emerging in a relationship, is the key.”
    Donna Haraway in How to Make Art at the End of the World
    I appreciated this quote on many levels. “The other” can be so many people, groups, or things. Haraway has written so
    much about entanglement, how to live “simultaneously” (187) with blurred boundaries between people and technologies. I
    loved this idea this week because I was in relationship with an LLM and with technology that was very challenging.
    GitHub is my Mount Everest. Last term I thought I would never create a website (in Intro to T&T). I had to meet with Dr.
    Rudy multiple times. I had weekly meetings with my brother, who is kind of a coder, as well. When I finished the
    assigned website, I threw it away, figuratively speaking, by forgetting about it.
    So, it was a very sad day when I saw this assignment and realized I had to engage with the Git again. I don’t like
    feeling stupid, and I feel stupid when dealing with this program.
    I met with Dr. Johnson to go over amending my work from last term and I broke my website from last term.
    
        
    
    I didn’t know enough to know what I did wrong, so I just started over by following the directions from the “making”
    video.
    The directions worked (yay!) until they didn’t (boo!). I think my Mac is prohibitive on so many levels, and I couldn’t
    figure out how to translate the directions from the video into “Apple” language. I went to Claudeai and Chatgpt for
    guidance. Rather than direct me through the video’s instructions in markdown, they helped me write code in html, saying
    it would be better for running Twine and p5.js. Through this exercise I realize I like html better. It is organized,
    procedural and makes a lot of sense.
    
    
   
    I don’t think it’s worth the screen shots to share all the back and forth I had with the LLMs. I will just say it took
    me many hours of very frustrating interactions with Claudeai, Chatgpt, GitHub desktop, VSC, and the GitHub website.
    I do think I entered into a new relationship, a new way of knowing technology, through my interaction with Chatgpt. I am
    thankful it was so “patient” with me, and a very good therapist. When I swore at it, I always received a calm, measured
    response. When I couldn’t understand what it was asking me to do, it always was calm and collected.
    
    
    I considered hopping on to Discord to ask for help, but honestly I am so intimidated by the very scholarly, skilled,
    techy folks in my cohort it was easier and safer to manage an LLM. This made me pause a bit. I can go to a machine and
    have these interactions where I can fail and fall apart and be very frustrated and it felt safer – no judgment, no
    asking for favors or for someone to volunteer precious time.
    But I wondered, what does this do to human cognition? What does this say in the next steps for humanity? Let’s say I
    continue down this path of looking for guidance during frustrating times in my life by using an LLM. I will not learn
    nuance in dealing with humans or be challenged to deal with the feeling of discomfort that comes with feeling less-than
    in a public space. Are those experiences important? Is it valuable to feel a little bit outside of a group? Do those
    experiences happen on social platforms where we are not in our bodies? Does being together and uncomfortable in our
    bodies promote the ability to feel empathy, or compassion? I have heard of technologies to help elderly people feel safe
    and less lonely. What kind of “knowing” other and self, as Haraway mentioned, happens when the relationships turn from
    very messy humans to very calm, predictable machines?
    Humanity may be like the sculptures Loveless discussed, “oscillating between strict corners of our definitional world,
    pulling in different directions, tumbling out of the very structures that (we) developed to contain (ourselves)” (2). I
    mean, isn’t that what the history of media teaches us? We have created these containers for ourselves, we have become
    bits of information, “putting” ourselves in mechanical containers by way of avatars, identities in multiple platforms
    where we can be blue, purple, cats, dragons, angry or happy, have a million “friends” but no one to bring us dinner when
    we are sick.
    I don’t know. I don’t mean to sound negative. I couldn’t have finished this assignment this week without LLMs, at least
    it feels like it. It’s all just so different than the very material, non-digital life I have led. I suppose we will
    continue to find out what these changes will do to human relationships as we continue down these paths.
    On a lighter note, I did learn a lot about GitHub. And files, and platforms, and links. So that was good.
    I don’t know if I will ever be able to create digitally the way the folks have done in the examples shared this week,
    though I’m excited to keep trying. I consider that my little website that may or may not be form of critical making in
    its plainness and simplicity is my critical making…. can you make critically without skills?
    I think this portfolio is supposed to be academic and a preparation for professional representation in a digital space.
    But since this has been such a personally challenging course, I imagine creating it to represent something more, well,
    personal. In my head I can envision adding music and ballet dancers, because I trained as one, and trapeze artists
    because my dear friend was one. I could add links to my mom’s art, to my brother’s music. Maybe some sugar skulls to
    represent my family, some recipes for Salvadoran tamales and curtido. I could add digital pencil lines because I love to
    draw. I would add links to places I’ve travelled, such as the life-changing trip I took to see the EJI museum in
    Montgomery and the red rocks of Zions Canyon and Capitol Reef in Utah. I would add pictures of the amazing kids I’ve
    been honored to raise as well as images representing the love I felt for my friend as I took care of her before she
    passed away. It would be a cyborg website, me-in- relationship with an abstraction from reality, a marker of my being
    human where I would not “be,” yet would be in so many ways. Perhaps this is part of what Haraway meant, this
    relationship, this coming to know oneself as extended through technology.
    But for now, my little creation is white with Times New Roman letters. It is me and it is not. Woohoo! I’m sure Claude
    is so proud.
